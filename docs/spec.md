## 0. Status of this document in the native rewrite

This spec was written while the TypeScript version was the implementation, so
parts of it describe an export architecture the native version does not have.
Committing to a GPU compositor as the only render path voids the following:

| Section | Status |
|---|---|
| §9, two-emitter registry | **Changed.** One emitter. The FFmpeg fragments are now the *specification* of each effect's maths for its HLSL shader, not an export path. |
| §11, FFmpeg export graph | **Void.** No filter-graph compiler, no concat-vs-overlay path selection, no command-line length problem. |
| §12, keyframe baking | **Void.** Real frames, keyframes evaluated live. |
| §13, frame-accurate export mode | **Void as a mode.** It is how export works. |
| §14, PNG round-trip for generated media | **Void.** Text and mattes rasterise directly into the compositor. |
| §20, gotchas 3, 5, 6, 7, 10 | **Moot.** Artefacts of the browser and CLI boundaries. |
| §20, gotcha 9 (audio gain easing) | **Fixed rather than documented**, since preview and export share one DSP path. |

Everything else stands: the data model (§5), editing operations (§6), segment
resolution (§7), the compositor model (§8), effect and audio-effect parameter
semantics (§9, §10), scopes (§15), and the UI (§18).

The native version additionally supports **HDR end to end**, which the
TypeScript version did not. See `architecture.md`.

Errata found while porting are corrected in place and marked **[corrected]**.

## 1. What Cutline is

Cutline is a **Premiere-style non-linear video editor (NLE)** for desktop. A user
imports video/audio/image media, arranges **clips** on a multi-track **timeline**,
applies **transforms, effects, transitions, keyframe animation, and audio
processing**, previews the result in real time in a **program monitor**, and
**exports** to an MP4 (H.264/H.265).

Primary real-world use so far: editing long gameplay screen-recordings (e.g. a
10-minute 4K `.mkv`) down into shorter clips/montages with effects and audio
cleanup. Design for **large 4K sources, long timelines, and MKV/long-GOP inputs.**

The current implementation is a Tauri app (Rust shell + web/TypeScript UI +
bundled ffmpeg). The rewrite targets **native C++** for performance (see §3).

### Product principles (keep these)
1. **The data model is the backbone.** Every subsystem (UI, preview, export) is a
   pure function of an immutable-ish project model. Editing ops take a project and
   return a new project; they never mutate in place. This made the TS version
   testable and predictable — preserve it.
2. **Preview and export must match by construction.** Each effect/behavior is
   defined once and rendered two ways (interactive preview + export encoder) from
   the same parameters. Never let them drift.
3. **Correctness and honesty over cleverness.** Where two renderers can't be
   pixel-identical (color math, chroma key, vignette), that's documented, not
   hidden.
4. **No emojis in UI.** Text / vector icons / Unicode geometric glyphs only.

## 2. Glossary

- **Project** — the whole editing session: canvas size/fps, media pool, tracks.
- **Media** — a source asset (video/audio file, image, or a *generated* source:
  text title, color matte, adjustment layer).
- **Track** — an ordered lane of clips; `video` or `audio`. Video tracks stack
  top-over-bottom for compositing; audio tracks are summed.
- **Clip** — a placement of a media on a track over a time span, with in/out
  points, transform, effects, etc.
- **Timeline time** — seconds along the sequence (the playhead lives here).
- **Source time** — seconds within a media's own footage.
- **Canvas** — the output raster (e.g. 1920×1080). Transforms are expressed in
  *canvas fractions*, so they're resolution-independent.
- **Segment** — a clip resolved for rendering (transitions expanded into overlaps;
  keyframes optionally baked into fixed slices). Derived, never stored.

---

## 3. Why the rewrite — constraints of the current stack

The current app is functional and pleasant to iterate on, but hit a hard wall:

- **Frame-accurate export is unusably slow.** Rendering exact frames requires
  seeking the source to each output time. In a browser `<video>` element this
  re-decodes from the nearest keyframe on *every* seek. For a 4K long-GOP **MKV**,
  that measured **~4.5 s per frame → ~18 minutes for an 8-second clip.** Browsers
  optimize for smooth playback, not deterministic random-access decode.
- **No direct frame access / GPU compositing.** Compositing is 2D canvas on the
  CPU; per-pixel work (chroma key, scopes) is JS. Fine for preview at reduced res,
  not for fast full-res rendering.
- **IPC + command-line limits.** Frames crossed a JS↔Rust bridge; the ffmpeg
  filter graph outgrew the OS command-line length limit (worked around with a
  filter-script file, but symptomatic).

**What the rewrite should buy you (design goals):**
- **Native decode** via libav*/FFmpeg libraries (or GPU decode) with **sequential
  decode** for export — no per-frame seeking. This alone fixes the headline
  problem.
- **GPU compositing** (e.g. a shader pipeline / a lib like Skia, or D3D/Vulkan/
  Metal) for real-time 4K preview and fast full-res export.
- **Frame-exact export == preview** with no browser in the loop, retiring the
  "approximate parity" caveats.
- Direct file I/O, threading, and no command-line marshalling limits.

**Two viable export architectures in C++ (pick per effect):**
1. **Own compositor → encoder.** Decode → composite on GPU/CPU → feed frames to
   the encoder (libavcodec, or NVENC/AMF/QSV). This is the "frame-accurate"
   path done right; it's fast when decode is sequential. Enables *any* effect.
2. **Describe-to-FFmpeg** for effects FFmpeg can do natively (color ops, crop,
   vignette, chroma key, blur). Cheapest to implement; already proven here.
   Keep this for the effects that map cleanly.

The current TS app already leans on (2) for speed. The rewrite should make (1)
first-class so canvas-only effects (masks, arbitrary compositing) are also fast.

**Keep from the current design:** the pure model, the two-emitter effect registry
concept, the segment-resolution algorithm, the export graph structure (as a
reference for the describe-to-FFmpeg path), and the exact effect parameter
semantics below.

## 4. Coordinate systems, time, and units

- **Canvas fractions.** A clip's position `x,y` are fractions of canvas width/
  height; **`(0.5, 0.5)` is centered.** Scale `scaleX,scaleY` are multipliers
  where **1.0 = "fit media to canvas, aspect-preserved"** (a clip at scale 1 fills
  the canvas as much as it can without distortion). Rotation is **degrees**,
  clockwise. This keeps transforms independent of export resolution.
- **Natural size.** A media's natural draw size at scale 1 is
  `min(canvasW/mediaW, canvasH/mediaH)` applied to `mediaW×mediaH` (aspect-fit).
  Text uses its laid-out pixel size.
- **Timeline vs source time.** For a clip with `start`, `sourceIn`, `sourceOut`,
  `speed` (>0), `reverse`:
  - `sourceSpan = sourceOut - sourceIn`
  - `clipDuration = sourceSpan / speed` (timeline seconds)
  - `clipEnd = start + clipDuration`
  - `sourceTimeAt(t)` (t in timeline secs, within clip):
    `lt = (t - start) * speed`; `reverse ? sourceOut - lt : sourceIn + lt`.
  - Sub-ranges (for splitting/trimming a retimed/reversed clip) map linearly with
    the same formulas; keep them reverse-aware.
- **Frame snapping.** The playhead snaps to frame boundaries at the project fps.
- **Time formatting.** Two distinct formats **[corrected]** — the original text
  conflated them. `secondsToTimestamp` gives `HH:MM:SS.ss` (two decimal places,
  frame-rate independent) for durations; `secondsToTimecode` gives Premiere-style
  `HH:MM:SS:FF` at the project fps, where `FF` counts whole frames within the
  current second, for the playhead readout.

## 5. Data model (authoritative)

All fields optional-with-defaults unless noted. Treat the model as
value types; editing returns a new project (structural sharing is an
optimization, not required).

### Project
```
Project {
  canvasW: int = 1920
  canvasH: int = 1080
  fps: number = 30                 // project/sequence frame rate
  media: Media[]
  tracks: Track[]                  // video tracks first (top), then audio
  markers?: number[]               // timeline seconds
}
```

### Media
```
Media {
  id: string
  path: string                     // absolute file path (empty for generated)
  name: string
  duration: number                 // source seconds (image: default placement len)
  hasVideo: bool
  audioStreamCount: int            // number of audio streams in the source
  width?, height?, fps?            // for picking export canvas / natural size
  // Stills / generated sources:
  isImage?: bool                   // PNG/JPG/GIF (looped on export)
  isAnimated?: bool                // GIF: animates instead of holding a frame
  isText?: bool;  text?: TextSpec  // generated title
  isColor?: bool; color?: string;  gradient?: { color2: string, angle: number }
  isAdjustment?: bool              // adjustment layer (no pixels of its own)
}
```
- **Generated media** (text/color/adjustment) have no file, no audio, infinite
  handles (behave like stills).
- **Still-like** = image | text | color | adjustment.

### TextSpec
```
TextSpec {
  content: string
  fontSize: number                 // canvas px
  color: string; fontFamily: string
  bold: bool; italic: bool
  align: "left"|"center"|"right"
  background: string | null        // solid box behind text, or none
  strokeColor?: string | null; strokeWidth?: number   // outline (canvas px)
  shadow?: bool                    // drop shadow
}
```

### Track
```
Track {
  id: string
  kind: "video" | "audio"
  label?: string
  clips: Clip[]
  hidden?: bool                    // video: excluded from render (the "eye")
  muted?: bool; solo?: bool        // audio: audibility (see rule below)
  locked?: bool                    // UI: not editable
}
```
- **Audibility:** a track is audible if not `muted` AND (no track is `solo` OR
  this track is `solo`).

### Clip
```
Clip {
  id: string
  mediaId: string
  kind: "video" | "audio"
  audioStream?: int                // which source audio stream (N in 0:a:N)
  sourceIn: number; sourceOut: number   // source seconds
  start: number                    // timeline seconds
  groupId: string | null           // linked clips move/cut together (A/V link)
  gain?: number = 1                // linear audio gain
  gainKeyframes?: Keyframe[]       // volume automation (overrides gain)
  opacity?: number = 1
  fadeIn?, fadeOut?: number         // seconds (alpha for video, gain for audio)
  transform?: Transform            // video only
  speed?: number = 1               // playback rate (pitch-preserved audio)
  reverse?: bool = false
  transitionOut?: { kind: TransitionKind, duration: number }  // at out-edge
  blend?: BlendMode = "normal"
  disabled?: bool                  // kept in place but not rendered
  keyframes?: { [AnimProp]: Keyframe[] }     // transform + opacity animation
  effects?: ClipEffect[]           // ordered visual effect stack
  audioEffects?: AudioClipEffect[] // ordered audio filter stack
}

Transform { x=0.5, y=0.5, scaleX=1, scaleY=1, rotation=0 }
AnimProp  = "x"|"y"|"scaleX"|"scaleY"|"rotation"|"opacity"
BlendMode = "normal"|"add"|"screen"|"multiply"|"overlay"|"darken"|"lighten"|"difference"
TransitionKind = "dissolve"|"dip-black"|"push"|"slide"
```

### Keyframe & interpolation
```
Keyframe { t: number, v: number, e?: "linear"|"hold"|"ease" }
```
- `t` = clip-local seconds; `v` = value. `e` is the **outgoing** interpolation
  toward the next keyframe (default linear).
- **Evaluation** `evalKeyframes(kfs, localT)`: clamp to first/last outside the
  range; within `[a,b]` compute `f = (localT-a.t)/(b.t-a.t)` then apply the
  *from-keyframe's* mode:
  - `linear`: value = `a.v + (b.v-a.v)*f`
  - `hold`: value = `a.v` (step; jumps at `b.t`)
  - `ease`: smoothstep `f' = f*f*(3-2f)`, value = `a.v + (b.v-a.v)*f'`
- Editing a keyframe preserves its `e`; a newly added keyframe inherits the
  property's current mode (first keyframe's `e`).
- Keyframes apply to: transform props, opacity, **effect params**, and
  **gain** (audio). (Gain easing is modeled but the current audio scheduler
  ramps linearly between breakpoints — see §10.)

### ClipEffect / AudioClipEffect
```
ClipEffect      { type: string, enabled?: bool=true, params: {k:number},
                  colors?: {k:string}, keyframes?: {paramKey: Keyframe[]} }
AudioClipEffect { type: string, enabled?: bool=true, params: {k:number} }
```
`type` keys into the effect registries (§9, §10).

---

## 6. Editing operations (model layer)

All are pure `(project, args) -> project`. The C++ version should expose the same
capabilities (names are indicative). Undo/redo is a stack of project snapshots.

- **Placement:** `placeMedia` (auto-creates audio lanes per stream, avoiding
  overlap — see note), `insertMediaAt` (ripple), `overwriteMediaAt`.
- **Move/trim:** move clips (with layer/track change), trim edges, `rateStretchEdge`
  (drag edge changes speed), `slipClip` (shift source under a fixed window),
  `slideClip` (move between neighbors).
- **Cut:** `splitAt` (razor; splits linked group together, reverse/speed-aware
  source mapping), `rippleDelete`, `removeClips`.
- **Grouping/linking:** `linkClips`/`unlinkClips` (shared `groupId`);
  `groupMembers`.
- **Properties:** set transform/opacity/fades/gain/speed(+reverse)/blend/
  transition/enabled.
- **Effects:** add/remove/toggle/move/clear, set param, copy/paste stack; colour
  params; effect keyframes (set/remove/clear + interp mode). Same set for audio
  effects.
- **Keyframes:** set/remove/clear per prop; set interp mode per prop; gain
  keyframes (rubber-band) with add/move/remove.
- **Tracks:** add video/audio track, set label, mute/solo/hidden/lock, remove.
- **Markers:** add/remove/clear/nearest/next/prev.

**Audio-lane placement rule (important, was a bug):** when a video with N audio
streams is dropped, each stream goes to a **distinct audio lane with no time
overlap**; if no existing lane is free at that time, create a new lane at the
bottom. Do not pile multiple streams/instances onto the same lane region.

---

## 7. Segment resolution (transitions → renderable segments)

Both preview and export derive **segments** from a track's clips. Pure function
`resolveVideoSegments(track, mediaDurationOf) -> VideoSeg[]`:

```
VideoSeg {
  clip; start; end; sourceIn; sourceOut
  xIn; xOut          // dissolve/dip alpha ramps (seconds)
  toBlack            // dip-to-black uses opaque fades (no cross-fade partner)
  slideKind?; slideRole?("in"|"out"); slideWin?{start,end}  // push/slide geometry
  // export keyframe baking (see §12):
  fixedTransform?; fixedOpacity?; fixedEffects?
}
```

Algorithm:
1. One segment per enabled clip, `start=clip.start`, `end=clipEnd`.
2. For each clip with `transitionOut` (duration d>0) that **abuts** the next clip
   (`|next.start - clipEnd| < 1e-3`):
   - `half = d/2`.
   - **dip-black:** A fades to black over `[T-half,T]` (`xOut=half`,`toBlack`),
     B fades in from black over `[T,T+half]` (`xIn=half`,`toBlack`). No overlap.
   - **dissolve/push/slide:** borrow up to `half` of each side's *source handles*
     (unused source beyond in/out) to create a real overlap. Extend A's tail and
     B's head (reverse/speed-aware source adjustment). Then:
     - **dissolve:** B cross-fades in over the overlap (`xIn = overlap`).
     - **push:** B slides in from the right AND A slides out to the left over the
       window. **slide:** only B slides in over A.
3. Geometric offset for push/slide at time `t`: fraction of canvas width,
   `segSlideOffsetX`: role "in" → `(1-p)*+1` (off-right→centered); role "out" →
   `p*-1` (centered→off-left), where `p = clamp((t-win.start)/(win.end-win.start))`.

Handles come from `mediaDuration - sourceOut` (tail) and `sourceIn` (head),
divided by speed, swapped under reverse.

**Rationale / decision:** transitions are done **geometrically + via handle
borrowing, NOT via ffmpeg `xfade`.** `xfade` was fragile against the compositor/
overlap model. Push/slide bake to per-slice transforms on export (§12). Keep this
approach; it's robust.

---

## 8. The compositor (preview render model)

The program monitor composites every visual clip active at the playhead. Render a
clean frame at canvas resolution as follows (this is also the model your C++
compositor should implement for the "own compositor" export path):

**Per frame, at timeline time `t`:**
1. Fill canvas black.
2. Gather active segments across **video tracks bottom-to-top** (tracks are stored
   top-first; render reversed so the top track draws last / on top). Within a
   track, draw earlier-`start` segments first (so a dissolve's incoming clip lands
   over the outgoing).
3. For each segment, dispatch by media type:
   - **video:** get the source frame at `sourceTimeAt(clip,t)`.
   - **image/GIF:** still or animated frame (GIF timed off the playhead).
   - **text / color matte / adjustment:** generated (see §14).
4. **Per-clip draw pipeline (order matters):**
   a. Resolve effect params at local time (fold in effect keyframes).
   b. **Chroma key** (if present): key the source to alpha on an offscreen buffer.
   c. **CSS-filter effects** (brightness/contrast/etc.): apply at device
      resolution (see gotcha below).
   d. Compute geometry: center = `(x + slideDx) * canvas`, size = natural×scale,
      rotation.
   e. Set **globalAlpha** = opacity × fade × transition ramp; set **blend mode**.
   f. **Flip** via axis scale (±1); **Crop** by drawing only the kept
      sub-rectangle; else draw full.
   g. **Vignette** overlay (radial gradient darkening) if present.
5. Selection handles/guides are UI overlays drawn only when not exporting.

**Opacity/fade/transition alpha** (`visualAlpha`): `opacity(t)` ×
fade-in/out multiplier (over `max(fadeIn, xIn)` / `max(fadeOut, xOut)`),
combined with dissolve/dip ramps.

**HiDPI gotcha (important):** applying a filter while the canvas has a
device-pixel-ratio scale rasterizes the filter at CSS resolution then upscales →
soft. The TS fix renders filtered content on an identity-transform offscreen at
**device resolution**, then blits unfiltered. In C++ with a proper render target
this is a non-issue if you render effects at full target resolution.

**Playback resolution (perf).** During playback the preview may render at ½ or ¼
resolution (Premiere-style "playback resolution: Full/½/¼"), full when paused. In
C++ this is optional but nice for very heavy timelines.

---

## 9. Visual effects registry (exact semantics)

**Design:** one registry, each effect defines parameters once plus two emitters —
a **preview renderer** and an **FFmpeg fragment** — from the same params, so
preview and export agree. Params are keyframeable (numeric). "Neutral" params emit
nothing. Effects are an ordered stack (order = apply order).

For the C++ rewrite: keep this two-emitter concept, but the "preview renderer"
becomes your GPU/CPU compositor op, and the "FFmpeg fragment" is for the
describe-to-FFmpeg export path (and as an exact spec of intended math).

Below, `p.x` are param values; ranges are `[min,max] default`. **FFmpeg fragment**
is the authoritative intended behavior.

| Effect | Params | Neutral | FFmpeg fragment | Preview |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Brightness** | amount [-100,100] 0 | 0 | `eq=brightness=${amount/100}` (3dp) | CSS `brightness(1+amount/100)` |
| **Contrast** | amount [0,300] 100 (%) | 100 | `eq=contrast=${amount/100}` | `contrast(amount/100)` |
| **Saturation** | amount [0,300] 100 | 100 | `eq=saturation=${amount/100}` | `saturate(amount/100)` |
| **Hue** | angle [-180,180] 0 | 0 | `hue=h=${angle}` (1dp) | `hue-rotate(${angle}deg)` |
| **Gaussian Blur** | amount [0,50] 0 px | 0 | `gblur=sigma=${amount}` (2dp) | `blur(${amount}px)` |
| **Black & White** | amount [0,100] 100 | 0 | `hue=s=${1-amount/100}` | `grayscale(amount/100)` |
| **Invert** (toggle) | on {0,1} 1 | 0 | `negate` | `invert(1)` (ctx filter) |
| **Flip** (toggles) | horizontal 1, vertical 0 | both 0 | `hflip` and/or `vflip` (comma) | axis scale ±1 |
| **Chroma Key** | similarity [1,100] 30 %, blend [0,100] 10 %; color `#00d000` | always on | `chromakey=0xRRGGBB:${sim/100}:${blend/100}` (3dp) | per-pixel keyer (below) |
| **Vignette** | amount [0,100] 40 % | 0 | `vignette=a=${(amount/100)*(π/2)}` (4dp) | radial-gradient darken |
| **Crop** | left/top/right/bottom [0,45] 0 % | all 0 | crop+pad (below) | kept sub-rectangle |

**Crop FFmpeg fragment** (l,t,r,b are fractions; RW=1−l−r, RH=1−t−b):
```
crop=iw*RW:ih*RH:iw*l:ih*t,pad=iw/RW:ih/RH:iw*l/RW:ih*t/RH:color=black@0.0
```
Cuts edges, keeps frame size, cropped area transparent (needs an alpha-carrying
format; on a single non-alpha track it becomes black bars). Preview draws the
source sub-rect `[l·w, t·h, RW·w, RH·h]` into the box sub-region
`[l·boxW, t·boxH, RW·boxW, RH·boxH]`.

**Chroma keyer (preview approximation of ffmpeg chromakey):** per-pixel, on an
offscreen buffer sized to the on-screen box (capped ~2560px wide for CPU JS; a
GPU shader has no such cap). BT.601 U/V distance:
```
U = -0.169R -0.331G +0.5B ;  V = 0.5R -0.419G -0.081B
d = hypot(U-Uk, V-Vk) / 255
alpha = 0 if d<=similarity ; 1 if d>=similarity+blend ; else (d-similarity)/blend
```
Not pixel-identical to ffmpeg; acceptable and documented.

**Adjustment-layer effects:** a subset can be **time-gated** onto the composite
below (color/blur only — brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, blur, grayscale).
Export emits each as `${fragment}:enable='between(t,start,end)'`.

**Composite chains:** preview CSS filters are space-joined into one `ctx.filter`;
ffmpeg fragments are comma-joined into the clip's filter chain. Neutral → omitted.

**Parity caveats to preserve/communicate:** color math (eq/hue vs CSS), chroma,
and vignette are close but not pixel-identical between preview and export. Gaussian
blur radius is resolution-dependent.

---

## 10. Audio system

**Playback model (real-time):** all video plays muted; audio is decoded per
(media, stream) and, on play, **every clip from the playhead onward** is scheduled
as `source → gain → [effect chain] → master`, summed. The audio clock is the
master timeline clock while playing (better A/V sync than a wall clock). Provide:
per-clip gain, fade in/out, volume automation (gain keyframes), master volume, a
peak/VU meter, track mute/solo.

**Reverse & speed:** baked into the played buffer. Speed uses a **pitch-preserving
time-stretch** (WSOLA-style overlap-add) so slow/fast clips keep pitch, matching
the export's `atempo`. Reverse plays a reversed buffer.

**Gain envelope scheduling:** combine automation × fade, sampled at breakpoints
(keyframes + fade edges) with linear ramps between. NOTE: this ramps **linearly**
between breakpoints even if a gain keyframe is marked `ease`/`hold` — to honor
easing on audio you must sub-sample eased segments (a known follow-up).

### Audio effects registry (exact)
Same two-emitter idea: a **Web Audio node** (preview) and an **FFmpeg fragment**
(export). The biquad-based ones are near-exact parity; the compressor is
approximate.

| Effect | Params | FFmpeg | Preview node |
|---|---|---|---|
| **High-Pass** | freq [20,2000] 100 Hz | `highpass=f=${freq}` | biquad highpass |
| **Low-Pass** | freq [500,20000] 8000 Hz | `lowpass=f=${freq}` | biquad lowpass |
| **Bass** | gain [-24,24] 0 dB (neutral 0) | `bass=g=${gain}` | lowshelf f=100 |
| **Treble** | gain [-24,24] 0 dB (neutral 0) | `treble=g=${gain}` | highshelf f=3000 |
| **Compressor** | threshold [-60,0] -18 dB, ratio [1,20] 4 (neutral ratio≤1) | `acompressor=threshold=${10^(dB/20)}:ratio=${ratio}` | DynamicsCompressor (knee 6, atk .01, rel .15) |
| **EQ Band** | freq [20,20000] 1000, gain [-24,24] 0 dB (neutral 0), q [0.1,10] 1 | `equalizer=f=${freq}:t=q:w=${q}:g=${gain}` | biquad peaking |
| **Notch** | freq [20,20000] 1000, q [0.1,20] 4 | `bandreject=f=${freq}:t=q:w=${q}` | biquad notch |
| **Gain** | gain [-24,24] 0 dB (neutral 0) | `volume=${gain}dB` | GainNode 10^(dB/20) |

Chain: enabled, non-neutral effects comma-joined; inserted after volume/fade,

## 11. Export pipeline (FFmpeg graph — reference for describe-to-FFmpeg)

The current exporter is a **pure compiler**: `(project, options) -> ffmpeg args`.
It is heavily unit-tested by asserting the resulting `-filter_complex` string.
Keep this pure-compiler approach for the FFmpeg export path in C++ — it's the most
testable part of the system.

**Options:** output path; width/height (canvas or preset); fps (source/24/30/60);
codec h264|h265; CRF (quality high/balanced/small map); optional In/Out range;
audio mode `mix` (sum to one stereo stream) | `separate` (one stream per track);
frame-accurate flag (the slow canvas path — deprioritized, see §13).

**Inputs:** one `-i` per used non-image media (provides both video and audio
streams). Each **image clip** gets its own looped input (`-loop 1 -t <total>
-framerate fps`, or `-ignore_loop 0 -t <total>` for animated GIF). Adjustment
layers have no input file.

**Video graph — two paths:**
- **CONCAT (fast path)** — used only when there's a single plain video track and
  *none* of: transforms, images, sub-1 opacity, fades, transitions, blends,
  keyframes, effect keyframes, adjustment layers. Build `[clip | black-gap]*` each
  as `trim → (reverse) → setpts(speed) → scale+pad to WxH → effects → fps →
  yuv420p → setsar=1`, then `concat=n=…:v=1:a=0[vout]`. Black gaps fill time
  between clips.
- **OVERLAY compositor (general path)** — `color=black[base]`, then for each track
  bottom-to-top, for each segment: overlay it (time-shifted, scaled, positioned,
  rotated, faded, `format=yuva420p` for alpha, effects after the format).
  Adjustment layers apply their **time-gated** effect chain to the accumulator
  instead of drawing. Ends `[…]null[vout]`.

**Audio graph:** per clip →
`atrim=start:end → (areverse) → asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS → atempo(speed) →
volume(const or eval=frame automation) → afade(in/out) → [audio effects] →
aresample=48000 → aformat=stereo → adelay=<startMs>:all=1[aN]`. Mix clips within a
track (`amix …:normalize=0`), then either sum all tracks (`amix` +
`alimiter=limit=0.95`) or emit each track separately, each limited.

**Volume automation expr:** piecewise-linear ffmpeg expression in `t` from the
gain keyframes, used as `volume=eval=frame:volume='<expr>'`.

**Range export:** trims the composed `[vout]`/audio to `[rangeStart,rangeEnd]` and
resets PTS. (In the frame-accurate path the frames are already the range, so only
audio is trimmed.)

**Encoding:** h264 (`libx264 -preset medium -crf N -pix_fmt yuv420p`) or h265
(`libx265 … -tag:v hvc1`); audio `aac -b:a 192k -ar 48000`; `-r fps -y out`.

**Command-line length:** a big graph exceeds the OS command-line limit → write the
graph to a temp file and use **`-filter_complex_script <file>`** (already done).
In C++ prefer the libav* API directly and avoid the CLI entirely.

**Keyframe baking (§12)** and **generated-media baking (§14)** feed this graph.

---

## 12. Keyframe baking for export

FFmpeg filtergraphs can't easily animate transforms per frame, so an animated (or
push/slide) segment is **expanded into short fixed-transform slices** and each
slice overlaid via the static path:
- Sample rate = `min(fps, 30)`, up to 600 slices per segment.
- Each slice `[a,b]` carries `fixedTransform = animatedTransform(mid)`,
  `fixedOpacity = animatedOpacity(mid)*fade`, `fixedEffects = resolvedEffects(mid)`
  (effect params baked), and any push/slide x-offset folded into `fixedTransform.x`.
- Because slices sample `evalKeyframes` at ~30fps, **easing/hold render correctly**
  on export automatically.

In the C++ own-compositor path this whole mechanism disappears — you just render
each real output frame with live-evaluated keyframes. Baking is only needed for the
describe-to-FFmpeg path.

---

## 13. Frame-accurate export (current beta — deprioritized)

An opt-in mode renders every output frame through the compositor at full res
(seeking each source, awaiting decode), stages a PNG sequence, and muxes with the
normal audio graph via a `videoFromFrames` compiler branch. It gives perfect
parity but is **very slow** for the reasons in §3 — this is exactly what the C++
rewrite fixes with native sequential decode + GPU compositing. Treat this TS
implementation as a *proof of the concept*, not a design to port literally.

---

## 14. Generated media

- **Text/title:** laid out and drawn with the same routine in preview and export.
  On export the text clip is **rendered to a transparent full-canvas PNG with its
  transform baked in** (then the transform is cleared, since it's in the pixels).
  Support: font family/size/color, bold/italic, alignment, optional background
  box, outline (color+width), drop shadow.
- **Color matte:** solid color or **linear gradient** (`color → color2` along
  `angle`°; 0=left→right, 90=top→bottom). Shared fill routine for preview and the
  export PNG. Keeps its transform (scale/position/keyframes apply).
- **Adjustment layer:** draws nothing; its effect stack filters everything on the
  tracks **below** it within its time span (preview re-filters the composite;
  export uses `enable=`-gated filters). Only the gate-able color/blur effects
  apply.

In C++ these are just compositor primitives (text rasterizer, gradient fill, and a
"filter the layers below" pass) — no PNG round-trip needed.

---

## 15. Video scopes (analysis, no export effect)

Overlay on the program monitor, sampling a downscaled copy of the output each
frame. Pure math, unit-tested; renders never affect the model/export.
- **Histogram** (R/G/B + luma, 256 bins).
- **Waveform** (luma distribution per column).
- **RGB Parade** (three waveforms side by side).
- **Vectorscope** (BT.601 Cb/Cr scatter; grey center, primaries toward the rim).
- Luma = BT.601 `0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B`.

---

## 16. Project persistence

- Save/Open a project as **JSON** (the whole `Project`), written/read via native
  file I/O. Choose a versioned schema (add a `version` field) so the C++ format
  can evolve. The current TS model *is* the schema (§5).
- **Autosave** periodically to a temp location.
- Media are referenced by absolute `path`; on load, missing files should be
  flagged (offer relink) rather than silently dropping clips.

---

## 17. Platform integration (what the shell must provide)

Current Rust commands (replicate equivalents natively):
- `probeFile(path)` → duration, streams, width/height/fps (ffprobe).
- `extractWaveform(path, stream)` → downsampled peaks for the timeline.
- `extractThumbnails(path, …)` → filmstrip thumbnails for clips.
- `extractAudioBuffer(path, stream)` → decoded PCM for playback.
- `runFfmpeg(args, onProgress, onLog)` → spawn + parse `time=` for progress +
  cancel. (In C++, prefer linking libav* over spawning a binary.)
- File I/O: read/write text (projects), write binary (snapshots/frames), make/
  remove temp dirs.
- Frame **snapshot** of the current program frame to PNG.
- **Auto-updater** (current app self-updates from GitHub Releases; optional for the
  rewrite but the friend relies on painless updates).

Bundle FFmpeg/ffprobe (or link libav*) so the app is self-contained.

---

## 18. UI / UX specification

Three-region layout (resizable splitters):

- **Project panel (left):** media pool (import, thumbnails, durations), buttons:
  Open, Save, Import Media, Export, Add Text, Color Matte, Adjustment Layer,
  Snapshot; Check for Updates; Maximize Video.
- **Program monitor (center):** letterboxed canvas with on-canvas transform
  handles (drag body=move, corners=scale (aspect-lock toggle), top handle=rotate),
  edge/center **snap guides**. Left of it, a context **Effect Controls / Text /
  Color Matte / Audio** panel for the selected clip:
  - **Effect Controls (video clip):** Motion (Position X/Y, Scale X/Y + aspect
    lock, Rotation, Opacity — each with a ◆ stopwatch to animate and a
    **Lin/Hold/Ease** interpolation chip when animated), Time Remapping (Speed %,
    Reverse), Composite (Blend), Effects (add-dropdown, per-effect card:
    ▲▼ reorder, On/Off, ✕ remove, param sliders with ◆ + interp chip, color
    pickers, toggles), Copy/Paste/Clear.
    - **Audio panel (audio clip):** Audio Effects (add-dropdown + cards).
  - Transport row: Play, Loop, **Scopes** toggle (+ tabs), **Preview** resolution
    (Full/½/¼), Canvas preset + custom W×H, timecode, VU meter, master volume.
- **Timeline (bottom):** ruler + tracks. Tools: **Select, Razor, Rate (stretch),
  Slip, Slide**; Snap toggle; In/Out; Marker; Link/Unlink; +Video/+Audio Track;
  Fit. Per clip: thumbnails (video), waveform (audio), fade handles, keyframe
  diamonds, gain rubber-band (Alt-click add point, drag). Per track: enable/lock
  (video), mute/solo (audio). Drag to move; drag edges to trim; playhead scrub.
- **Export dialog:** Resolution, Frame rate, Codec, Quality, Audio (mix/separate),
  **Frame-accurate (beta)** checkbox; progress overlay with % and Cancel.

Keyboard: standard transport/tool shortcuts (Play/space, V/C/R/Y/U tools, I/O
in/out, J/K/L shuttle, S snap, marker keys, undo/redo). Reproduce a Premiere-like
feel.

**Canvas presets:** 1920×1080, 2560×1440, 3840×2160, 3440×1440 (UW), 2560×1080
(UW), 1080×1920 (vertical), 1080×1080 (square), custom.

---

## 19. Testing philosophy (carry over)

The TS project keeps a large suite of **pure unit tests** over the model, the
effect registries, and the **export compiler** (asserting exact ffmpeg fragment
strings). This caught real bugs and enabled confident refactors. In C++:
- Keep the model and export-graph builders pure and table-test them.
- Snapshot-test effect fragment strings.
- Add golden-image tests for the compositor once GPU rendering exists.

---

## 20. Known gotchas & non-obvious decisions (read before coding)

1. **Transforms are canvas fractions; scale 1 = aspect-fit-to-canvas**, not
   1:1 pixels. Get this right or everything is mispositioned.
2. **Video tracks are stored top-first but composited bottom-first.**
3. **Transitions use handle-borrowing + geometry, not `xfade`.** Deliberate.
4. **Effects do not force the overlay export path** (except adjustment layers /
   things needing alpha); a plain single track with only color effects stays on
   the fast concat path.
5. **Filter parity is approximate** for color/chroma/vignette; exact for
   crop/flip/invert and the biquad audio filters.
6. **HiDPI filter softening** (canvas-specific) — moot in a native render target.
7. **Command-line length** — moot if you link libav* instead of spawning ffmpeg.
8. **MKV/long-GOP seeking is the core perf villain** — design export around
   sequential native decode, never per-frame seeks.
9. **Audio gain easing** is modeled but not yet honored by the scheduler/export
   (linear ramps between breakpoints).
10. **Generated media** currently round-trip through PNGs on export — unnecessary
    in a native compositor.

## 21. Feature checklist (parity target for the rewrite)

Multi-track timeline; drag/trim/split/ripple/insert/overwrite; snapping; markers;
grouping/linking; tools (Select/Razor/Rate/Slip/Slide); undo/redo. Per-clip
transform (pos/scale/rotation), opacity, blend modes, fades, constant speed +
reverse (pitch-preserved audio), keyframes (transform/opacity/effect params/gain)
with Linear/Hold/Ease. Visual effects: brightness, contrast, saturation, hue,
blur, B&W, invert, flip, chroma key, crop, vignette (stackable, reorderable,
copy/paste, keyframeable). Adjustment layers. Generators: text titles, color
mattes (solid/gradient). Transitions: dissolve, dip-to-black, push, slide. Audio:
per-clip volume + automation, fades, master volume, VU meter, mute/solo, audio
effects (high/low-pass, bass, treble, compressor, EQ band, notch, gain). Scopes:
histogram/waveform/parade/vectorscope. Program monitor with transform handles +
snapping + playback-resolution. Export: H.264/H.265, CRF, resolution/fps presets,
In/Out range, mix/separate audio, progress + cancel; snapshot to PNG. Project
save/load + autosave. Auto-update (optional).

**New capability the rewrite unlocks (the whole point):** fast, frame-exact export
via native decode + GPU compositing, making canvas-only effects (arbitrary masks,
shape masks, wipe transitions, real motion blur, etc.) cheap and exact.

*End of spec. The `src/core/` TypeScript (model, `effects.ts`, `audioEffects.ts`,
`export.ts`, `scopes.ts`) is the authoritative reference for exact numeric output
and edge cases; this document is the map.*
